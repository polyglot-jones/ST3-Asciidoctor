= AsciiDoc: Drag Images

The "`AsciiDoc: Drag Images`" command is a quick way to embed images in your document using the `image::[]` macro.
It's a 2-step process:

. Drag one or more images to Sublime. Sublime will display each image in its own tab.
. Switch back to the tab with your AsciiDoc document and invoke the "`AsciiDoc: Drag Images`" command.

It will make a list of all of the file names of the open image tabs, closing each tab as it goes. (All non-image tabs are left alone.) Then, it will insert `image::path/image.jpg[]` into the document at the cursor -- one line per image -- where "`path/image.jpg`" is the actual path, name, and extension of the image.
