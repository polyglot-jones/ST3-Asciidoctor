# About

This is a SublimeText plug-in (package) that enhances the experience of writing documents using AsciiDoc (AsciiDoctor) markup.
At a high level, this package offers:

- Syntax Highlighting (with customizable color schemes)
- A (growing) library of snippets to save on typing common elements
- A (growing) library of commands that do some "heavy lifting"
- Configuration settings that tell SublimeText how to best work with AsciiDoc (e.g. file associations, and build commands that generate HTML and EPUB output).


## Project Status

This is a fork of the __[sublimetext-asciidoc]__ package from the [Asciidoctor Project], created by [Matt Neuburg] and [Jakub Jirutka]:

- https://github.com/asciidoctor/sublimetext-asciidoc

The original package is buggy, and that repository has not been maintained (stale since August 2015).
Numerous pull requests with fixes to some of the known problems were never merged.
Furthermore, the original package uses the old `.tmLanguage` syntax format.

This fork addresses all of that.
This is currently considered a "usable alpha" (as of early 2021).
Indeed, it's used daily on large, complicated AsciiDoc projects.
The "alpha" status merely reflects that implementation details are subject to change (e.g. how the syntax scopes are named).

Here's a brief summary of how the original package was improved so far:

- The AsciiDoc syntax was ported from the old `.tmLanguage` syntax format of __Sublime Text 2__ to the `.sublime-syntax` format of __Sublime Text 3__. (Before migrating, several third party fixes to known problems found in other forks were incorporated. See [Credits section].)
- A suite of syntax tests were added to maintain integrity during development.
- Poorly handled syntax highlighting (for certain markup elements) have either been fixed or disabled.

## Goals

1. *Not settling for a poor syntax-highlighting implementation.* The old (`.tmLanguage`) syntax definition often misinterpreted perfectly valid syntax as being something else. This would cause the highlighting to go wonky part-way through the document.
So markup features that were causing trouble have been disabled here, because "less is more" when having to chose between feature richness and features that actually work.

2. *To reach enough maturity to warrant becoming a full-fledged package hosted on [Package Control].*
Unless and until somebody surprises the AsciiDoc community by releasing an AsciiDoc [language server], this package will have to suffice.

3. *To encourage adoption and feedback,* by providing excellent documentation and responsive support.

4. *To encourage contributions.* Lively discussions are taking place in https://github.com/tajmone/ST3-Asciidoctor/discussions and https://github.com/tajmone/ST3-Asciidoctor/issues.


## Issues

The main problem is that the AsciiDoc syntax is quite complex, so it's not easy to cover (nor predict) every possible combinations of its markup elements, especially so in syntax definitions which are, basically, just huge RegExs-based settings files — ideally, an AsciiDoc package should be implemented as a language server, via [LSP].

Syntax break-downs usually occur due to wrong parsing precedences leading to false positives in various contexts.
Since AsciiDoc offers many alternative ways to express its markup elements, finding the right precedence in every context can be quite hard, especially when introducing new elements in the syntax definition, which often breaks previously defined elements that were working fine.

For the above reasons, it's possible that during the Alpha stage various syntax elements will be temporarily disabled from time to time, due to new contextual problems rising when other elements are added, fixed or reintroduced.


# Features


## File Associations

This package associates AsciiDoc with files that end in: `.ad`, `.adoc`, or `.asciidoc`.


## Syntax Highlighting

This package includes an AsciiDoc-specific syntax definition.
With it, SublimeText will accordingly apply a (customizable) color scheme to any AsciiDoc file.

## Symbol Lists

Document and section titles are displayed in the local symbol list ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) and the global symbol list ( <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>).
In the local symbol list, titles are nicely indented.
In the global symbol list, titles will start with `=`, so you will know they belong to AsciiDoc files at a glance. Also they will be on top of the list because of the precedence of `=`.


## Completions

* Provides completions for attributes (built-in and locally defined) and cross references (local anchors and titles).


## Special-Purpose Commands

|        Command                      |   Notes                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AsciiDoc: Drag-and-Drop Images      | Generates `image::[]` macros for dropped images [DRAG_IMAGES.adoc](Docs/DRAG_IMAGES.adoc) |
| AsciiDoc: Fix Up Converted Document | Applies various fixups to a freshly converted document (e.g. from MS Word to AsciiDoc via PanDoc) [FIXUP_CONVERTED.adoc](Docs/FIXUP_CONVERTED.adoc) |
| AsciiDoc: Renumber Chapters         | If your chapter titles contain the chapter number (`== 99: ...` or `== Ninety Nine: ...`) -- or you want them to -- this will (re)number them if they get moved/deleted/inserted. [RENUMBER_CHAPTERS.adoc](Docs/RENUMBER_CHAPTERS.adoc)  |



# Installation

> __IMPORTANT__ — If you have installed the __[sublimetext-asciidoc]__ package, you must uninstall it before attempting to install this package!
>
> If you've installed the __[AsciiDoc][ST2 AsciiDoc]__ package, you're strongly advised to uninstall it, or disable it, or at least to manually associate the AsciiDoc extensions (`.adoc`, `.asciidoc` and `.ad`) with this Asciidoctor plugin.

Right now, this repository is not a full-fledged package that can be installed using the [Package Control] directory.

You should therefore install it manually, via Git:

1. From your terminal, navigate to your Packages subdirectory under the ST3's data directory:
    * OS X: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/`
    * Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/`
    * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\`
2. From that directory, invoke Git to clone this repository into the `Asciidoctor` subdirectory:

        git clone https://github.com/tajmone/ST3-Asciidoctor.git Asciidoctor

3. Restart SublimeText.

## Brian Thomas Smith

Before converting from the old `.tmLanguage` format to the newer `.sublime-syntax` format, I've integrated various syntax fixes and improvements from [Brian Thomas Smith]'s __[asciispec-sublime]__ repository (commit [@087a9d00911]), which is also a fork of the __[sublimetext-asciidoc]__ package.

# Acknowledgments

I'm in debt with the whole [Sublime Forum] community for all their kind support over the years; and I'd like to expressly thank the following users for their support in matters directly related to this project:
[@facelessuser],
[Ashwin Shenoy],
[Keith Hall],
[Raoul Wols].


# Contributing

Any contribution to this project is most welcome, whether it's a suggestion submitted by [opening an Issue], or contributions to its code via pull requests using Git.

All pull requests should be submitted on the `dev` branch, not on `master`.

Furthermore, to preserve a clean history, pull requests will be merged by rebasing on the `dev` branch; so we might ask you to rebase your PR branch again after code reviewing the PR.

Pull requests can contain multiple commits if they address different features and fixes (indeed, one commit per feature is preferable over packing together unrelated fixes and improvements), but multiple commits amending a single feature should be squashed into a single commit before merging.

All pull requests should pass the Travis CI build, which also checks code styles consistency via [EditorConfig], to prevent spurious noise in commits diffs.
