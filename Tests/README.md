# AsciiDoc Syntax Test Suite

This directory contains the testsuite for the AsciiDoc ST4 syntax.
Most tests are self-documenting and can be converted to HTML via Rake by typing `rake` in the Shell/CMD.

# Directory Contents

Test files are grouped in subfolders according to category; tests which don't belong to any specific category are kept in the this root tests folder.

- [`/blocks/`][blocks/] — block elements.
- [`/quotes/`][quotes/] — inline quote markup elements.
- [`/tables/`][tables/] — AsciiDoc tables (deserve a folder of their own).

## Naming Conventions

The following naming conventions apply to this directory tree:

- `syntax_test_*.asciidoc` — syntax tests that are valid AsciiDoc documents.
- `syntax_test_*.adoc` — syntax tests that are malformed AsciiDoc documents.
- `_syntax_test_*.asciidoc` — disabled test files that fail syntax testing.
- `*.asciidoc` — misc. non-test documents, for information purposes.
- `___*.*` — Files and folders ignored by Git.


# HTML-Convertible Test Files

Every `*.asciidoc` test file is also a valid AsciiDoc source file, which can be converted to HTML via Rake for the following purposes:

1. Verify with Asciidoctor that the test file is a valid AsciiDoc source, and capture any formatting errors and edge cases (i.e. formatting not working as expected).
2. Simplify tracking the syntax tests by reading them as documents that explain the nature of the tests, providing examples and and references links.

For this purpose, syntax constructs are usually presented twice in a row: first in their source form (within a listing block), then in their HTML rendered form (within an example block, where comments are used for scope testing).

The size-bloat added by this approach to the test files shouldn't be a concern, for tests are only carried out by developers and maintainers of the syntax.
On the other hand, this approach simplifies understanding how the test suite works, making it easier to join the project for anyone wishing to contributing to the syntax.

Besides, AsciiDoc being a rather complex syntax, the need for well-documented tests is a felt need, because there are many edge cases to keep in mind during the tests, and because any changes to the syntax definition could easily introduce unexpected breaking behaviors.

To avoid cluttering the final document with excessive syntax examples, syntax tests which should be excluded from the final HTML document are placed inside a conditional preprocessor directive evaluating to false:

```asciidoc
ifeval::[0 == 1]
...
endif::[]
```

This also allows carrying out tests outside example blocks, as it's usually done for documented tests.


# Plain Test Files

If a test file has the `*.adoc` extension it means that it's a malformed AsciiDoc document, and it will not be converted to HTML by Rake.

These files either contain tests for malformed constructs, which would fail conversion, or because they require using an alternative comment delimiter in the first line, in order to allow correct testing of some rare edge-cases contexts, which makes the document nonconvertible due malformed header.

Although these `*.adoc` files won't be converted to HTML, you can still view them in ST4 for manual inspection, to ensure that malformed contents are handled properly by the syntax, which should fallback gracefully in order to prevent breaking syntax highlighting for the rest of the document.


# Running the Tests

To run the entire testsuite:

1. Open and select the `Syntaxes/Asciidoctor.sublime-syntax` file in ST4,
2. Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to bring up the __Build With__ options,
3. Select __Syntax Tests__.

After having run the tests once, you can henceforth use just <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> to run further tests.

Alternatively, you can use the menus __Tools__ » __Build With__ and __Tools__ » __Build__.

To test a single file, apply the same as above but from within the target test file.

# Adding Test Files

Every test file must be named according to the `syntax_test_<markup element>.asciidoc` convention, and the very first line must contain the following comment:

```asciidoc
// SYNTAX TEST "Packages/ST4-Asciidoctor/Syntaxes/Asciidoctor.sublime-syntax"
```


# Disabled Tests

All tests must pass without any error in the package published on `master` branch; therefore, any failing test file must be renamed by prefixing an underscore (`_syntax_test_*.asciidoc`), thus excluding it from ST4 tests.

There can be various reasons why a test file is disabled:

- It catches some edge case problems that need to be addressed.
- Its target markup element was temporarily disabled in the syntax.

Whatever the reason, we keep them in the repository so that they can be quickly re-enabled by removing the leading `_` from their name, and resume working on the markup elements they target.


# Non-Tests Documents

This directory also contains some `*.asciidoc` files which are not part of the test suite; they are plain AsciiDoc files annotating pending tasks and problems, and for visually inspecting how syntax elements are rendered in various context — i.e. just reference material not being tested for.
